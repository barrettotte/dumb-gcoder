# dumb-gcoder

A dumb GCODE generator made to learn more about GCODE and 3D print my cat some basic shapes it loves to play with.

This is a dumb project so I'm only targeting the specs of my 
[Creality Ender-3 Pro](https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-pro-3d-printer).

Maybe one day I'll try writing a small general purpose slicer.

TODO: picture of cat

I only made a square, rectangle, circle, and ellipse.
I also wanted to make an n-gon as a list of coordinates, but just lost motivation to do so.
